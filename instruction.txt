Context and Objective

You will create the first stage of a SaaS application designed to help users automatically generate YouTube video scripts by analyzing the best-performing videos from a specific channel. The SaaS will use the YouTube and Claude.ai APIs to analyze existing content and generate new content optimized for YouTube.

What you need to do for this first step :

1. technical set-up of the project

- Initialize a Next.js project with integrated Tailwind CSS.
- Configure TypeScript right from the start.
- Use the Tailwind CSS framework combined with shadcn/ui to quickly create a simple, intuitive user interface.

2. Creation of essential pages (Frontend)

Create the following pages:
- Welcome (Home)**: A very simple page with a short description of the SaaS and a “Start Analysis” button.
- Analysis**: A page containing an input field allowing the user to paste in a link to a YouTube channel, with a clear button to start the analysis (this button will not yet be functional in this stage, just the interface).

3. Creating the initial backend structure

- Prepare a simple route API in Next.js that will eventually be used to communicate with the YouTube API.
- This route API for now will simply return a basic test JSON `{ status: “API functional” }` to confirm that everything is ready to use.

4. Deployment

- Connect this project to GitHub and host it on Vercel so that you can test directly online after each modification.

5. Clear summary of deliverables

At the end of this step, you should have :
- A functional, well-structured Next.js project, configured with TypeScript and Tailwind.
- Two simple, uncluttered pages (Home and Analysis).
- A working route API (even basic).
- A functional version deployed on Vercel for immediate testing.

This step forms the clear, clean technical base on which all advanced functionalities will then be progressively added.
